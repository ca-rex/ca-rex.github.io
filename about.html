      <p> Ca-Rex, officially Ca-Rex News Firm, is a major rival newspaper of The Messan Gazette. It is one of the two major newspapers of Carevîa. Leonardo Peritus Rex publishes a multi-page newspaper monthly. The majority of Ca-Rex articles are based on national affiars, and the minority dedicates to other articles and sections. Ca-Rex is looking for shares. 98 out of 100 shares are available. </p>
      <h2> History </h2>
      <h3> Preview Stage (9/6/25-Now) </h3>
      <p> Ca-Rex started making previews on the day it was founded. Initially, they started making previews. The previews were very successful, and Lolan was given privileges to publish it further. </p>
      <h3> Risk Sub-Stage (12/6/25) </h3>
      <p> On 12/6/25, Ca-Rex leakes an article that contained misinformation about international politics, greatly angering the leader of the targeted nation. To apologise, Leonardo Peritus Rex proposed the Rex Act that would have warned the lower classes to not post anything about international politics. The legislation failed, as the Şahzade of Carevîa refused to sign it. It didn't mean that the Şahzade of Carevîa will not give Ca-Rex a second chance, though. Ca-Rex still continues to publish international information that has nothing to do with politics. </p>

      <h1> Leonardo Peritus Rex </h1>
      <p> Leonardo Peritus Rex is the founder of Ca-Rex News Firm. He is a very controversial figure, almost ruining his reputation in the media business. He has a YouTube channel (@TheLolanGamer). He is also an amateur coder. </p>
      <h2> History </h2>
      <h3> Citizenship Stage (3-8/6/25) </h3>
      <p> Leonardo Peritus Rex joined Stoneworks on 3/6/25, after Pielolyo accepted his /tpa request. He became a citizen of Carev. He donated all his money ($4 949) to help support Carevîa's independence against Kohwa. That donation will be important later. </p>
      <p> He was bounty hunted by Deuterity, the same person who first documented the mysterious c*ck. Lolan was once hunted for 100 lapis and 64 diamonds, but he doesn't have any money - he is in debt with $64 000 to pay. </p>
      <h3> Merchant Stage (9/6/25-Now) </h3>
      <p> He started making some money. He worked in the cake market, and at one point, he earnt $5 000 in one day. Currently, he still has $47 000 to pay left. He also made Ca-Rex as well. Lolan and Deuterity made a deal that if one kills the other, they have to give them gold.</p>
      <h3> Short Peace Sub-Stage (16/6/25-The Next Abex-Spawn Shop Rotation) </h3>
      <p> He made a short peace with Deuterity because the next abex-spawn shop rotation was coming soon. Both of them needed to work together to make some money. He still kills Lolan but with no bounty. </p>
